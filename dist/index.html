<h3 id="head-of-digital-engine-creative-https-www-enginecreative-co-uk-2013-present"><strong>HEAD OF DIGITAL</strong> / <a href="https://www.enginecreative.co.uk/">ENGINE CREATIVE</a> (2013 - PRESENT)</h3>

<p>My role at Engine is varied - I&rsquo;m involved in the full lifecycle of all digital projects that run through the studio from new business enquiries, through their implementation and ongoing support. I find it particularly rewarding to be able to bring both our creative team and the business needs of our clients together to either make a process easier or to allow them to innovate within their respective sectors. I also pride myself on my ability to explain otherwise techical subject matter in plain English to stakeholders regardless of their involvement or position.</p>

<p>Approximately 75-80% of my time is still writing code (something I&rsquo;m very grateful for), with a typical day likely calling for a wide range of my skillset. I have had the pleasure of working in a diverse range of scenarios whilst at Engine mentoring other developers in house, providing support in consulting roles to larger development teams and managing exernal freelance resource.</p>
