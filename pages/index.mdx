## **Staff Engineer** [Hopin](https://hopin.com/) <span className="date">2021 - Present</span>

I'm currently working as a tech lead at Hopin, an events startup that grew rapidly during COVID-19. The pods I work with build tooling that enables third parties to create apps and integrations with Hopin - these teams maintain our REST API, webhooks, in-event applications (e.g. interpretation) and our upcoming Javascript SDK. I've enjoyed being able to spend much more time mentoring other engineers at Hopin both at a direct technical level and on their own career progression.

I've recently also taken on a role as a maintainer of our inner-source module federation framework, which supports teams in being able to continuously deliver their features in isolation from the containing application. This has seen significant adoption within Hopin.

**Key Responsibilities**

- Working alongside product owners to derive a compelling DX for Hopin
- Communicating a coherent techincal vision to the teams I work with
- Championing high standards and best practice
- Mentoring of engineers across the organisation

Purple is one of the best known agencies for e-learning in the UK, working with household names like Levi’s, Gucci, Kaspersky and many domestic phone carriers.

My experience with emerging concepts such as responsive design and offline web apps helped them embrace the move to native web technologies and to further their support for content designed for mobile and table devices.
