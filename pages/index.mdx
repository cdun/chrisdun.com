## **Lead Engineer** / [Charlotte Tilbury](https://www.charlottetilbury.com) <span className="date">2018 - 2021</span>

Joining at the start of significant investment into technology, I was part of a team hired to give Charlotte Tilbury an advantage over it's competitors through not only product but superior experience throughout. 

My initial attraction was due to an opportunity to use my previous experience with augmented reality to improve the product offering. Having worked in e-commerce in the past, I was happy to be able to work closely with the product, data and marketing teams and to steer the technical direction of the engineering team to meet and exceed the ambitious targets set by the business.

**Key Responsibilities**

- Technical mentoring and leadership of 10 engineers

## **Front end Developer** / [Purple Media](https://www.purplemedia.co.uk/) <span className="date">2012 - 2013</span>
Purple is one of the best known agencies for e-learning in the UK, working with household names like Levi’s, Gucci, Kaspersky and many domestic phone carriers. I joined them around the time that Flash was falling from dominance for rich multimedia content. My experience with emerging concepts such as responsive design and offline web apps helped them embrace the move to native web technologies and to further their support for content designed for mobile and table devices. 


## **Front End Developer** / [Two Seasons](https://www.twoseasons.co.uk/) <span className="date">2010 - 2012</span>
GSM is the parent company of many surf and skateboard brands globally, most famously Billabong, Element and Nixon watches. I had an existing relationship with one of their child brands, Two Seasons, from previous employment as their product photographer. After they were purchased by GSM I rejoined as sole developer and designer for their eCommerce site. I’m proud of what the small team I was a part of accomplished in turning that into the highest revenue storefront for the brand by some margin.
